While setting up Facebook API, use the compile statement for dependencies from the quick start section. Using + is the version number can lead to unpredicted stuff suggestion given by android studio

FB android getting started docs say: You can add multiple key hashes if you develop with multiple machines

When making a GraphRequest, call executeAsync() from the UI thread for the callback to work.

got this -- Warning: Request without access token missing application ID or client token
code2care.org blog says add application id to manifest. I have done that.

another -- An active access token must be used to query information about the current user

Learn to read JSON response!

Warning for Default File Template
Method invocation listView.setAdapter() may produce nullpointerexception -- add assertion for listView object to check if its null
fab -- null pointer exception

fb graph api explore:
GraphRequest request = GraphRequest.newMeRequest(
  accessToken,
  new GraphRequest.GraphJSONObjectCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted(JSONObject object, GraphResponse response) {
      // Insert your code here
    }
});

Bundle parameters = new Bundle();
parameters.putString("fields", "id,name");
request.setParameters(parameters);
request.executeAsync();


didn't add callback for the loginButton. Did it for LoginManager instead.
Error: Failed to find provider info for com.facebook.katana.provider.PlatformProvider
and more like these. StackOverflow says update Facebook app.

added onActivityResult method.

JSONObject was returned to the GraphRequest not JSONArray
errors: failed to find provider info for AttributionIdProvider and PlatformProvider
Facebook app is updated, app id is right, internet permission is added

Platform provider error solved. Most likely because Facebook app updated.

Looks like I'm going to have to use GraphRequest.newMeRequest instead of making a new GraphRequest(). Making changes because newMeRequest returns a lot of data.
These are the only two methods to get data using Graph api.

Useful api references:
Place - a place
Place topic - category of a place page
Place tag - place tag

Using public feed API and keyword insights API for nearby events/ fun places.
Find recent posts from Instagram and others if possible to let the user see what is going on there.

// another idea - get discount coupons/ deals/ checkins when at a or near a place offering discounts

executeAsync()
Executes the request asynchronously. This function will return immediately, and the request will be processed on a separate thread. In order to process result of a request, or determine whether a request succeeded or failed, a callback must be specified (see the setCallback.setCallback(Callback) method).

Using newPlacesSearchRequest on graph to search for places nearby

Now you need to request permission from user every time you need to access sensitive data like location in this case.
You should check permission availability and request it not available. Persmission can be checked from a service and requested from an activity only.

A service is simply a component that can run in the background even when the user is not interacting with your application. Thus, you should create a service only if that is what you need.

****
In versions of Google Play services prior to 6.5, you had to compile the entire package of APIs into your app. In some cases, doing so made it more difficult to keep the number of methods in your app (including framework APIs, library methods, and your own code) under the 65,536 limit.

From version 6.5, you can instead selectively compile Google Play service APIs into your app.

Implement connectionsCallback and onConnectionFailedListener.

When a call is made to Facebook Graph API, it takes some time but the app doesn't wait and uses the available friendsList field which is unpopulated at that moment.
Need to find a way to invoke it after result is returned.

More changes in what to pass to FriendsListActivity. Passing friends list as ArrayList<String> and retrieving in FriendsListActivtiy using serializable. Serializable is applicable only if the type E is serializable and it also reduces performance***** still using it!

Tabbed activity for displaying the important content.
FragmentPagerAdapter: best when navigating between sibling screens representing a fixed small number of pages
FragmentStatePagerAdapter: best for paging across collection of objects for which the number of pages is undetermined. It destroys fragments as the user navigates to other pages to minimize memory usage.

Need to know what exactly is called at what time when a tabbed activity is called/displayed.
Apparently, class extending FragmentPagerAdapter is called first and it uses methods from class extending Fragment to display content in the tabs.
The latter class is responsible for creating a view that is displayed.

getItem() in class extending FragmentPagerAdapter is responsible for conveying what is to be dispalyed in the tab.

Get the number of check-ins in the last hour on Facebook, Instagram, Yelp and display posts in a listview.

PrimeActivity has auto generated code consisting of an inner class that extends Fragment. Trying to use this class by making it extend ListFragment.

When extending any PagerAdapter, FragmentPagerAdapter or FragmentStatePagerAdapter, we need to override few methods at minimun.
while using FragmentPagerAdapter: getItem(int) and getCount()
getItem(int) returns the fragment associated with a specified position.
getCount() returns the number of views available.

When is getItem(int) called?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19339500/when-is-fragmentpageradapters-getitem-called
Whenever adapter needs a fragment and the fragment does not exist. This method is called by FragmentPagerAdapter's instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int position) method.

Change the number of tabs through the getCount() method. Simply return the number of tabs you want to be displayed. Looks like this method is called by the Adapter which then sets up the tabs.

Inner class is not extending ListFragment. App stopped unfortunately saying there should be listview in your content with id android.r.id.list
Added a listview to the layout file with the required id. App works but not sure if lists are showing.

Tried using an ArrayAdapter to populate the list with a temporary string array. Error occured saying ArrayAdapter requires the ID to be a TextView
Didn't use the right layout list while instantiating the arrayadapter. Need to use one of the predefined/ built-in list items - android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1.

Now it shows the same list on every fragment.

If you use simple_list_item_2, the same error occurs as above. Looks like this is because the listview supports simple text which is in the form of textview.

newPlacesSearchRequest working. Result not displayed in the app; just logged in.
Log does not show the complete result when indentation is used. Also the result displayed is repeated.
